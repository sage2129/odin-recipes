    <h2>Description</h2>
        <div class="description">
            Authentic, Vietnamese pho soup is all about the broth! Beef bones, fish sauce, star anise, and ginger simmer for at least 6 hours, 
            <br>creating a complex aromatic broth that  may not be quick, but it's certainly delicious. The flavorful broth is ladled over rice noodles 
            and thinly sliced beef and topped with fresh garnishes.
